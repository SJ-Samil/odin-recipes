    <h1>Mushroom Stir-Fry</h1>
    <img src="../images/mashroom.webp">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This mushroom stir-fry features a medley of mushrooms: shiitakes for meaty texture and earthy flavor, and beech and enoki mushrooms for visual appeal and textural interest. Who needs meat? The recipe makes just enough sauce to coat the vegetables, but feel free to double the sauce ingredients if you'd like extra to serve over rice or noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, thinly sliced diagonally</li>
        <li>6 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces, whites and greens separated and divided</li>
        <li>Blah blah Blah</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Make the stir-fry: Heat peanut oil in a large wok over high heat. Add celery and onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add shiitake and beech mushrooms, and white parts from green onions; cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
